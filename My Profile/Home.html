      <p class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia u-text u-text-4"> My name is Michael I have a European background,
but I was born in Australia. In 2019 I graduated from year 12 and pursued
plumbing for about 2 years and realised that I wouldn’t be happy working as a
plumber for the rest of my life so now I work part time as a plumber while I
study IT at RMIT. When I'm not working or studying, I like to play games with a
bunch of friends.</p>

                <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-georgia u-text u-text-2">My interest<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> in IT started when I played a
video game on the pc when I was 8 years old, I found it difficult to make
friends at school and I couldn’t find anything to do at home. That’s when I
started playing games on the computer and Nintendo 64. Playing games helped me throughout
all my schooling, taking me away from the real world that’s filled with stress
and anxiety at times. I've always felt attached to computer technology ever
since I started using it, but I've never learnt how they work and what happens
behind the scenes, so now I want to take my chance to take my interest in IT
further by taking an IT course and to find my passion in IT. I currently have
my eye on Cyber security but I'm not 100% sure what that career involves in
detail.</span>

important asset to the team and this job of being a Cyber security analyst for
a bank will be a challenge I'm up for. At this point in time, I'm very interested
and curious about coding, networking and I enjoy dealing with numbers.&nbsp;<br>I don’t
fully understand coding and networking, but I believe there are a lot of
numbers involved which makes it more interesting for me. 
To be successful
in this role I will need to will have demonstrate experience in a Security
Operations Centre.<br>
        <br>I need experience in Vulnerability Management, Cloud Management
&amp; Defence, and to be able to work in a team with almost not supervision &nbsp;
We are seeking
an individual with the ability to work as part of a team and work under limited
supervision. Share knowledge you have and follow BOQ values for the benefit of
the team.
Since I just
started IT, I have no experience yet but ever since I graduated high school I’ve
learnt how to work as a team and communicate to clients and co-workers as a
plumber.
I plan to
complete this course to learn the base structure of IT which will help me when
I start a cyber security course.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>A family friend has a high position job at a
cyber security firm and told me I can work there if I do well at university and
if I complete the course they support. After that they will interview me. This
will be my first step into my career and the BOQ job is my goal.

transport users to ride a bus, tram and train without needing to tap as you get
on and off and to bring an end to fare evaders. Myki cards will still be around
for those who don’t have a phone.</p>

      <div class="u-clearfix u-sheet u-sheet-1">
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia u-text u-text-1"><b>Motivation</b>
          <br>In the past I have noticed how people use
public transport and haven’t paid. “New statistics from Public Transport
Victoria show thousands of Victorians have been fined for not having a valid
ticket on public transport. “The Herald Sun” reports that each day around 167
people are caught fare evading.” That’s around 60,000 people a year not playing
for their fare and that’s only from the ones who have been caught, this statistic
may even be doubled if every fare evader was caught. Fare evaders can occur
from not tapping your Myki as you get onto the vehicle or into the station,
another way is applying for a concession card without having a concession ID
which has cheaper fares to adult Myki’s. Public transport can get very
congested at peak hour and can end up being 15 minutes late down its route
which can make people late for their job and meetings.
        </p>
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia u-text u-text-2"><b>Description</b>&nbsp;<br>The new Myki system will be implemented into
the pre-existing PTV app which already has a great structure to build from. To
help stop fare evading Myki users who hold a Senior, Concession, or a child
Myki will have to renew their Myki every six months to verify that the card
holder is using the correct Myki. This can be done via the phone app or ticket box
at a train station. Concession card users can verify with a Victorian Health
Care Card, Australian Pensioner Concession Card or PTV ID (Primary, Secondary,
Tertiary or Asylum Seeker). If your Myki isn’t renewed, then it will lock, and
no money can be added to it, but you’ll be able to use the remainder of money that’s
still on the Myki.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>To implement the touchless Myki there will
be a PTV network on the trains, trams and bus’s that’s connects automatically
with a chip planted inside of the Myki card and connects to the signals the PTV
app outputs when in use. New Myki cards will be rolled out gradually replacing
the old Myki cards with the new chip inside. The fare starts once the Myki has
fully connected to the network and once the vehicle has travelled a short
distance.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>This ensures that people who aren’t on the
transport won’t get charged. When the Network recognises a Myki, it connects
the Myki to the network which is then connected to the satellite. The satellite
tracks the Myki travel and sends the data to the server. Once the Myki leaves
the local network area that’s on every vehicle and enters the network that’s at
every vehicle stop the money will be transferred through the PTV server within
the PTV network. The touchless Myki on the mobile will be available right away,
all you need to do is signup to touchless Myki on the PTV app and follow the
prompts. Auto top up can also be enable so you don’t have to keep manually
adding money to your Myki.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia u-text u-text-3"><b>Tools and Technologies</b>&nbsp;<br>The software needed to be the face of the
idea is the PTV app. The app is easy to navigate, and it already has everything
you need about public transport in Melbourne on it. 
Networks, servers and satellites are all
needed to work together to register the Myki ticket, determine the fare and to
transfer the money to PTV. 
The server is what connects all the devices
(Myki’s) and connects it to a local network or a wide area network. A server
collects and sends information and sends it to the correct systems across the
network. The Network connects all the servers and computers together so they
can communicate data to each other.

        <span style="font-weight: 700;">App developer</span>: An app developer is a
computer software engineer whose job is creating, testing and programming apps
for computers, mobile phones, and tablets. App developers usually work in teams
and think of ideas and concepts for their clients. The app developer will oversee
updating the design and code of the PTV app so users can create a touchless
Myki card.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Computer network architect</span>: Designs and constructs
data communication networks. These can include local area networks, wide area
networks, which can range from a small connection to a global connection.
Computer network architects also take care of upgrading software like network
drivers and hardware, such as adapters or routers. Computer network architects
are responsible for building the network for the systems, servers and computers
to share data to each other.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Electrical engineer</span>: Designs, develops,
tests and manages the manufacturing of electrical equipment and systems, such
as electric motors, smartphones and power generation equipment. Electrical
engineers are required to design and build the Myki cards with the wireless
chip.
It will be more difficult to find these
skills than finding the hardware but not impossible, this job for these skills
can be advertise on social media and seek. After gaining the skills required
it’s about the budget and funding of the project idea.

      <p class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia u-text u-text-2"><b>Outcome</b>&nbsp;<br>There are some pros and cons to this
project idea. Some being that the ticket inspectors may not be needed as much
to check tickets, however the numbers of fare evasion will drop significantly
and there won’t be any more waiting for people to top up their Myki or trying
to scan their Myki as they enter and leave the vehicle allowing public
transport to arrive on time if there isn’t any traffic.
